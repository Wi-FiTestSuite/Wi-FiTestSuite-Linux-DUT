================================= Release 02.30 =================================


This release is an incremental release for support for the Voice - Personal
program.  This release includes the following main differences from the previous
released version 02.10 Test Engine software package.

A. Improvements to existing WFA Test Engine code

	1. Fixed bugs
           Read the revision histories in the files:
           wfa_main.h, wfa_dut.c, wfa_sock.c, wfa_tg.c, wfa_tlv.c and wfa_ca.c

	2. Rewrote the throttled method in lib/wfa_tg.c. Again, please read the
           comments carefully and do your homework to adopt to your device (tuning?)

	3. Added Buzz() function in wfa_tg.c to precisely handle time sensitive
	   packet delivery.

	4. Move the partial initialization code in wfa_dut.c to a new file "wfa_dut_init.c"
	   

B. Voice Support

	1. Added clock synchronization through the addition of two new profiles:
	   (start_sync and finish_sycn).  Please read CAPI specification document
	   (version 1.5) for more details on these new profiles.

	2. Added the End-to-End delay measurement Synchronization method (wfa_dut.c)
	   The DUT clock is synched with the Test Console and the average minimum
	   delay is measured. Clock Drift is also measured.

	3. Added code so tests will log timestamps and the final report is saved
	   in a file (/tmp/e2eXXXXXXXX.txt).  The file is saved and collected for
	   final performance analysis.
